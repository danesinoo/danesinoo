ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @danesinoo, you're gonna find me on instagram with the same name.\
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in nothing, but computer science. Kidding, I like science in general, my second choice about university would have been physics, though I even like mathematics.\
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code at the university.
  * I have followed Python 4 Everybody, so I've been intriduced to python3.
  * I have read Beginning Rust: From Novice to Professional.
  * Finally, I finished the first coding course, at the university.
