ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @danesinoo, you're gonna find me on instagram under the same nickname.\
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in nothing, but computer science. Kidding, I like science in general, my second choice about university would have been physics, though I even like mathematics.\
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code at the university.
  * I followed Python 4 Everybody, so I've been intriduced to python3.
  * I read Beginning Rust: From Novice to Professional.
  * I am completing the bachelor's degree in Computer Science
  * I am going to study at University of Copenhagen Computer Science, with special focus on machine learning
